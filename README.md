# my_cook_2017

About 2 months long project, we actually spent 1 month fully working on this

The goal is to make a cooking mama like game, where you will have orders and recipes.
There are a lot of things to discover in this game, you will need to have the graphic library installed to run this

This is the most complete game we could produce, since we were in a hurry some things aren't optimized but it is working pretty well.


-Compile:

make

-Run:

./my_cook
